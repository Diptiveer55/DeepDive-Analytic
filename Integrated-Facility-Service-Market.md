The growing reliance on outsourcing will continue to drive market expansion.</li></ul><h2>Market Demand & Projections for 2023-2033</h2><p>As businesses evolve and new technologies disrupt the traditional facility management landscape, the global IFS market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-10% from 2023 to 2033.
